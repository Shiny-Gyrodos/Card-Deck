This is a simulation of a classical card deck.

It is it's own class and file, so it can be easily copy/pasted into any project where cards are needed. Cards created are objects of the Card class.

Some features of this code are:

1. CreateDeck, EraseDeck, and Draw cards functions.
2. Customizable hand limit, draw amount, hand remove amount.
3. You can acces the card's value (2, 5, 11, etc.), suite (hearts, diamonds, etc.), and name (five, ace, queen, etc.).

Thanks for checking out my dumb stuff.
